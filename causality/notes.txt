Feature extraction from wavelet-decomposed time series data involves identifying and leveraging significant characteristics from the decomposed components. Here’s a detailed guide on how to extract features effectively:
Steps for Feature Extraction
Wavelet Decomposition:
Use a wavelet transform to decompose the original time series into several components, each corresponding to different frequency bands.
Common wavelet functions include Haar, Daubechies, and Coiflets.
Use a library like PyWavelets for this task.
Obtain Decomposition Coefficients:
The result of the wavelet decomposition will be a set of coefficients for each level of decomposition.
These coefficients can be treated as new features for the time series data.
Extract Statistical Features:
From the wavelet coefficients, extract statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, energy, entropy, etc.
These statistical features provide a summary of the characteristics of each frequency component.
Create Feature Vectors:
Combine the extracted features from all levels of decomposition into a feature vector.
This feature vector represents the time series data in a reduced form, capturing essential characteristics.
Example Implementation in Python
Here’s a step-by-step example using PyWavelets and NumPy:
1. Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import pywt
import numpy as np
2. Generate Sample Data
python
Copy code
# Generate sample time series data
time_series = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)
3. Perform Wavelet Decomposition
python
Copy code
# Perform wavelet decomposition
wavelet = 'haar'
coeffs = pywt.wavedec(time_series, wavelet, level=3)
4. Define Feature Extraction Functions
python
Copy code
def extract_features(coeffs):
    features = []
    for coeff in coeffs:
        features.append(np.mean(coeff))       # Mean
        features.append(np.std(coeff))        # Standard deviation
        features.append(np.max(coeff))        # Maximum
        features.append(np.min(coeff))        # Minimum
        features.append(np.sum(np.square(coeff)))  # Energy
    return features
5. Extract Features from Decomposed Coefficients
python
Copy code
# Extract features from wavelet coefficients
features = extract_features(coeffs)

# Convert to numpy array for further processing
features = np.array(features)
print("Extracted Features:", features)
6. Preparing Data for LSTM
python
Copy code
# Prepare feature vectors for LSTM
window_size = 10
X = np.array([features[i:i + window_size] for i in range(len(features) - window_size)])
y = time_series[window_size:]

# Reshape X for LSTM input
X = X.reshape(X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)
7. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
python
Copy code
# Split data into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]
8. Build and Train the LSTM Model
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Build LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
9. Make Predictions and Evaluate
python
Copy code
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = np.mean((predictions - y_test)**2)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
Summary
By decomposing the time series using wavelet transforms and extracting statistical features from the decomposed coefficients, you can create a comprehensive feature set that enhances the performance of an LSTM model. This approach allows the model to capture both short-term and long-term patterns effectively, potentially outperforming standard LSTM or ARIMA models.

Wavelet Transforms with LSTM
Wavelet transforms are useful for decomposing time series data into different frequency components, which can help in capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies. This can enhance the LSTM model's ability to learn patterns in the data. The steps are generally as follows:
Wavelet Decomposition:
Apply wavelet transform to decompose the time series into various frequency components.
Common choices include Haar, Daubechies, and Morlet wavelets.
Feature Extraction:
Extract features from the decomposed components. These features can capture important characteristics of the original time series.
Model Training:
Use the extracted features as input to the LSTM model.
Train the LSTM model on these features to predict future values.
Inverse Wavelet Transform:
Combine the predictions from different frequency components using the inverse wavelet transform to reconstruct the forecasted time series.
Comparison with LSTM and ARIMA
LSTM Alone: LSTM models are powerful for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data. However, they might struggle with high-frequency components or noise in the data.
ARIMA: ARIMA models are effective for linear patterns in time series data. They can handle seasonality and trends but might not perform well with non-linear patterns or complex interactions.
Benefits of Using Wavelet Transforms with LSTM
Improved Feature Representation: Wavelet transforms can decompose time series data into more meaningful components, allowing the LSTM model to learn better representations.
Noise Reduction: By focusing on specific frequency bands, wavelet transforms can help reduce noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
Enhanced Model Performance: Combining wavelet transforms with LSTM can lead to better model performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.
Practical ImplementationSelect a Wavelet: Choose an appropriate wavelet based on the nature of your time series data.
Decompose the Time Series: Apply the wavelet transform to decompose the time series.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the decomposed components.
Train LSTM Model: Use these features to train the LSTM model.
Inverse Transform: Reconstruct the forecasted time series using the inverse wavelet transform.
Example Framework
Here's a simplified example in Python using the PyWavelets library and TensorFlow/Keras:
python
Copy code
import pywt
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample time series data
time_series = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)

# Wavelet decomposition
coeffs = pywt.wavedec(time_series, 'haar', level=3)
features = np.hstack(coeffs)

# Prepare data for LSTM
X = np.array([features[i:i+10] for i in range(len(features) - 10)])
y = time_series[10:]

# Split into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]

# Build LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
mse = np.mean((predictions - y_test)**2)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
Conclusion
Using wavelet transforms in conjunction with LSTM models can potentially yield better results than using LSTM or ARIMA models alone, particularly for complex and noisy time series data. The key is to effectively decompose the data and extract meaningful features for the LSTM model to learn from.
